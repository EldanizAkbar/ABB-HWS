AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used in web development to send and receive data from a server without having to reload the entire web page.
AJAX allows JavaScript to communicate with the server asynchronously, update specific parts of a web page, provide a better user experience, and improve the performance of web applications.
