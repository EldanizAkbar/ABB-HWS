In JavaScript, when we talk about asynchronous programming, we're referring to a way of writing code that allows tasks to happen independently of each other. Normally, JavaScript code runs in a single sequence from top to bottom, where each line of code executes one after the other.
However, there are situations where certain tasks take longer to complete, such as fetching data from a server or waiting for a user's input. In traditional synchronous programming, these tasks can cause the entire program to pause and wait until they are finished, which can lead to slow and unresponsive applications.
Asynchronous programming solves this problem by allowing us to start a task and then move on to the next one without waiting for the first task to complete. We can provide a callback function that gets executed once the task is finished. This way, the program can continue executing other tasks in the meantime, making our applications more efficient and responsive.
